# Numerai Compute

## Introduction

Compute is a framework to help you automate your weekly submission workflow __with your own infrastructure.

Use the [numerai-cli](https://github.com/numerai/numerai-cli) to provision your infrastructure, and deploy your pre-trained model as a server that listens for new tournament data, runs your model and uploads the predictions back to Numerai.

## Quick start

```text
pip3 install numerai-cli

mkdir example-numerai
cd example-numerai

# set up your compute node in AWS
numerai setup

# copy a python example model
numerai docker copy-example

# build the docker container and deploys it to AWS
numerai docker deploy

# trigger your compute node in AWS
numerai compute test-webhook

# watch the logs of the running compute node from AWS
numerai compute logs -f
```

## Timing <a id="getting-started"></a>

Once you've added your webhook url to your [account settings](https://numer.ai/account), Numerai will execute your webhook on Saturday at 19:00 UTC \(an hour after the round starts\). If we haven't successfully received your submission by Sunday 2:00 UTC, we will email you a warning that it looks like your compute job has failed. If it failed, we will try to trigger your compute webhook again on Sunday 19:00 UTC and if it fails again, we will send out a final email on Monday 2:00 UTC.
